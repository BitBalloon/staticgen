description: The fastest way to create a documentation site for your project.

Docute is basically a JavaScript file that fetches Markdown files and renders them as a single-page application.

It's totally runtime-driven so there's no server-side components involved which also means there's no build process. You only need to create an HTML file and a bunch of Markdown documents and your website is almost ready!

Antora makes it easy for tech writers to create documentation and publish it to the web. 
As a tech writer, you simply author content in AsciiDoc, Antora’s content markup language. You then organize those files into a standard project structure in one or more content repositories. Antora picks up your content from there and transforms it into a website. That’s all there is to it!

With Antora, you manage docs as code. 
That means your documentation process benefits from the same practices used to produce successful software.
Some of these practices include:
* Storing content in a version control system.
* Separating content, configuration, and presentation.
* Leveraging automation for compilation, validation, verification, and publishing.
* Reusing shared materials (DRY).

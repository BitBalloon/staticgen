Tired of your WordPress sites getting hacked?

A static site closes all the doors that an out of date WordPress, theme or plugin can leave open.

Your visitors not sticking around due to your site loading too slow?

A pre-generated static site can outperform popular caching plugins like WP Super Cache, WP Fastest Cache and W3 Total Cache.

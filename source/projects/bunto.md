Bunto is a modern and smart static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity. Bunto takes your content, renders Markdown, HTML, WIKI and Liquid templates, and spits out a complete, static website ready to be served by hostSE, Apache, Nginx or another web server. Bunto based on Jekyll which is the engine behind [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). So you can also use Bunto to host sites right from your GitHub repositories.

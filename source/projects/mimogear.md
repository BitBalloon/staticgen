Mimogear compiles, distributes, watches, & deploys a pug template boilerplate, a sass skeleton stylesheet, and a javascript module bundle with gulp & travis ci. _All you have to do on your end after installation is to run the `gulp` command and get rollin!_

### Philosophy

In the heart of Mimogear lies **simplicity**, **speed**, and **flexibility**. This foundation builds on the constant thought and revision of markup, styles, and modules that hold true to most use cases without blasting through the learning curve roof. As a result, Mimogear serves as a reliable base for front end web development.

Knowfox is a Personal Knowledge Management System. It helps you manage a hierarchy of concepts, using Markdown, YAML configurations and auto-scaled image uploads.

Through the web interface, you can generate an arbitrary number of static web sites from a concept subtree. Knowfox converts individual nodes in the concept hierary into web pages with breadcrumbs and navigation links between pages.

### Blade templating

Knowfox is written in Laravel, the friendly PHP framework for web artisans. Laravel comes with the powerful, simple, and beautiful templating engine Blade. Knowfox runs your concepts through Blade to generate a static site, complete with index and detail pages, images, and a flexible navigation bar at the top.

### Markdown for content pages

Markdown is a powerful yet simple to use writing format for things like articles, blog posts, or documentation pages.

Knowfox takes your content written in Markdown, runs it through a layout easily created with Blade templates, and created a beautiful website from it.

### Friendly content management built in

You edit your content in Knowfox's friendly web interface. This way, even a non-technical person can have a website that requires next to no resources to operate and maintain.

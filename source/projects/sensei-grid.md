description: Simple and lightweight data grid in JS/HTML.
---

Simple data grid library written in JavaScript. The data grid is part of Datazenit, a web-based database administration tool.

Currently not intended for production use. This is the first public release, and the project is currently under active development.

#### Goals

* Simplicity: Sensei Grid will be a single purpose data grid without unrelated functionality.
* Small code base: Bloatware and dirty workarounds/hacks will be avoided as much as possible to keep the code base small and tidy.
* Extensibility: Even though Sensei Grid will be kept simple, we will put serious effort to make it easy to extend and customize.
* Stability: Sensei Grid is backed by Datazenit, meaning that the project is financially supported and will be constantly maintained and improved.

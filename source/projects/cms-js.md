CMS.js is fully client-side, Javascript site generator in the spirit of Jekyll
that uses plain ol' HTML, CSS and Javascript to generate your website. CMS.js
is like a file-based CMS. It takes your content, renders Markdown and delivers
a complete website in Single-Page App fashion...without the aid of server-side
scripting (no Node.js, PHP, Ruby, etc.).
